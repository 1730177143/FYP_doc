    <h3>"Seek to Survive: A Comprehensive Design and Development of a Side-Scrolling Survival Game Incorporating Base
        Building and Tower Defense Mechanisms"</h3>
    <h2>Title 2 - Commercial Title:</h2>
    <h3>"Base Defense: The Last Stand"</h3>
    <h2>Project Description:</h2>
    <p>Seek to Survive merges strategic base-building with intense tower defense in a side-scrolling adventure. Players
        upgrade bases, fend off enemy onslaughts, and navigate through upgrades and attacks that intensify over time.
        This game invites players into a pixelated world where strategy and quick thinking are key to survival. The
        player's journey is filled with challenges that test their ability to defend, upgrade, and expand their
        stronghold against waves of enemies. Utilizing materials collected from fallen foes, players enhance their
        base's defenses and capabilities, aiming for victory by outsmarting enemy attacks and fortifying their bastion
        against the relentless siege.</p>
